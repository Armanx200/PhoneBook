# PhoneBook

Phonebook Management System
This C++ program implements a simple phonebook management system using file I/O operations. The phonebook is stored in a text file named phonebook.txt. The program allows users to add new phone numbers, mark existing numbers for expropriation, and delete specified numbers from the phonebook.

Features
- Add Number: Users can add a new phone number along with a national code to the phonebook. The program checks for duplicate entries before adding.
- Expropriate Number: Users can mark a phone number for expropriation, changing its status to 0 and nullifying the national code.
- Delete Number: Users can permanently delete a specified phone number from the phonebook.

Usage
- Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
- Run the compiled executable.
- Choose from the menu options:
  - 1: Add a new phone number.
  - 2: Mark a phone number for expropriation.
  - 3: Exit the program.

File Handling
- The phonebook data is stored in the phonebook.txt file.
- The program reads and writes to this file to manage phonebook entries.

Note
- Ensure that the program has the necessary file read and write permissions.
- Please review the code for any customization or modifications based on specific requirements.
- Use responsibly and ethically.
